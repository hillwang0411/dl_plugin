# From cmake documentation:
# True if the constant is 1, ON, YES, TRUE, Y, or a non-zero number.
# False if the constant is 0, OFF, NO, FALSE, N, IGNORE, NOTFOUND, the empty string, or ends in the suffix -NOTFOUND.
# Named boolean constants are case-insensitive.
#
# While this regex does contain a check for an empty string that check does not work
# cmake's regex is weak
